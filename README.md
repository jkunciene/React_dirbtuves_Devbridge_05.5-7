### ECMAScript 2015+ features

In this application we will be using some features introduced with recent versions of javascript.

To make sure it will also work on the older browsers we will be using babel to compile our code to "older" javascript.
Babel comes as a part of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) that is why you do not see it in [package.json](./package.json), but you may still find it under "node_modules" directory after successful `npm install`.

You can try how babel works in your browser here: https://babeljs.io/repl
 
Check the features that we have used in this project in [docs/js-features.md](docs/js-features.md).
