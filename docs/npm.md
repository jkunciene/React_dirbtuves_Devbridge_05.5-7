# NPM

npm is the worldâ€™s largest software registry.
Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages,
and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

## package.json

Dependencies that our project will be using are defined in `package.json`
that should be located at the root folder of the project.

[Creating a package.json file](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file)

### Dependencies

* `dependencies` - Packages required by your application in production.
* `devDependencies` - Packages that are only needed for local development and testing.

[Specifying dependencies and devDependencies in a package.json file](https://docs.npmjs.com/specifying-dependencies-and-devdependencies-in-a-package-json-file)

### npm install

When setting up the project and after any changes on dependencies in package.json, you will need to run `npm intstall` to install/update dependencies.

### npm-scripts

npm scripts are scripts that we can define under `"scripts": {` section in package.json.

* `"start": "react-scripts start",` - start is usually the main script used for development, in our case this runs the application in development mode on "localhost:3000". Tu run this use `npm start` command (it is a shortcut to `npm run start`).
* `"build": "react-scripts build",` - this script will build production ready application in "/build" directory under the root of the project.
* `"test": "react-scripts test",` - `npm run test` aka `npm test` is prepared to run test files.
* `"eject": "react-scripts eject"` - create-react-app adds a lot of commonly used features to our project, to be able to customize those feature we would need to run `npm run eject` script to move all configurations from `react-scripts` to our project code base.

Notice "react-scripts" used in each of our defined script, these are default scripts generated by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) when creating this project.

#### Try adding your own script

Add `"test-and-build": "npm test -- --watchAll=false --passWithNoTests && npm run build"` to `scripts` in package.json.
Try running it with `npm run test-and-build`.
