# Git

We need to install git be able to pull this project code from the repository (in our case bitbucket)
and to be able to navigate different versions of the code.  

## Installation

### MacOS

Apple ships a binary package of Git with XCode.
XCode can be downloaded from the App Store.
Or using command line: `xcode-select --install`

After successful install run `git --version` in your terminal.
You should see something like this:
```text
git version 2.24.2 (Apple Git-127)
```

### Windows

Git for windows can be downloaded from this site: https://git-scm.com/download
During the setup feel free to select default settings or by you own preferences.
After installation, you should have "Git Bash" terminal application.

In Git Bash try checking git version using `git --version`. Example output:
```text
git version 2.24.1.windows.2
```
